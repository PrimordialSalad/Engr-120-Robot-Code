# Engr120RobotCode

This is the final code that was used on the robot for the Engr 120 design project.  It was designed to find a beacon that outputed IR light and connect something to it, in this case string.  We used IR phototransistors, 4 on each of the 4 cardinal directions, to detect the beacon.  It performs well in sunlight settings but can get slightly confused.  One issues is if the beacon is moved excessively it will go into search mode and not be able to refind the beacon.  For whatever reason.  It also used a electromagnet that mechnically moved an arm which clicked a button to disconnect the string when we had found the beacon.  It also used push buttons, limit switches, and a sonar sensor for extra location detection and wall detection.  This was built primarily with a VEX kit and the code was programmed in Robot C.  The code is not efficient by any means but effectively gets the job done.  I would probably refactor if I had time into smaller functions and fix the issue described above.
